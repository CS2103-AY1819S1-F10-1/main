<h3 id="major-enhancement-user-accounts"><a class="link" href="#major-enhancement-user-accounts">Major enhancement: User accounts</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Added <strong>full fledged functionality for user accounts.</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Allows each employee to identify themselves with a username and password, similar to most modern systems. It provides:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Username and Password</strong> implementation for each employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to <strong>login and logout</strong> into each employee&#8217;s accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to <strong>secure the employee&#8217;s account</strong> through the changing of passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete modern-day security using <strong>salted and hashed passwords</strong> with 256-byte salts and SHA512 hashing algorithm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: It is critical to ensure the privacy of employees by keeping their private information secure and only viewable by specific people. Thus, this feature allows the use of user accounts to verify that there is appropriate authorization, ensuring that employee data isn&#8217;t publicly viewable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The password command requires large changes to ensure that passwords input by the user aren&#8217;t viewable through the history command. To solve this gacefully, I implemented a feature for <code>LogicManager</code> to have a List of interceptors, which are a <code>FunctionalInterface</code> that allows the processing of a Command. This allows the password changing command to work without adding excessive coupling between <code>Command</code> and <code>LogicManager</code>. Security for each user was essental to ensure that a user cannot read commands entered by another user. This was implemented by clearing user-specific data after logout.</p>

<p>The communication between <code>UI</code>, <code>Logic</code> and <code>Model</code> is mainly from using <code>EventsCenter</code> and firing events to tell the other components to act.
The following detailed steps show how the program works as the user login.:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>When the program is started, UIManager creates the MainWindow and tells it to <code>fillLoginParts()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user enters his details, and clicks login.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This causes the <code>LoginForm</code> to fire a <code>LoginEvent</code> onto the central EventBus, with the username and password saved into the <code>LoginEvent</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Logic Manager catches the LoginEvent. It then checks if the username and password combination matches a person in the system, or the admin user. To do so, it communicates with the <code>model</code> to retrieve everyone in the system.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If there is no successful match, then a <code>FailedLoginEvent</code> is fired. The LoginForm catches this Event and displays the error message provided by the FailedLoginEvent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a successful match, then a <code>SuccessfulLoginEvent</code> is fired. This event contains the person that is currently logging in, wrapped in a User object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>mainWindow</code> class catches the <code>SuccessfulLoginEvent</code> and processes it, removing the login UI Elements and replacing it with <code>fillInnerParts()</code></p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Create a login screen before initializing other UI elements on the fly.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: One single window. Clear to the user which window to focus on. Most applications work this way, so it should be familiar to the majority of our users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Harder to implement. Need to take into account other possible UI elements, preload only those that are required, and ensure that tests stay supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Build another UI Window just for login. Before logging in, this window will popup. Once the user has logged in, the login window will close and the main window will pop up.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Far easier to implement. Login system abstracted away from other functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: It will be hard to maintain the same window size as the login window, if the user resizes it. More coupling would be required to maintain the same window size. Very odd and unfamiliar to most users. No application today opens a login window, then on successful login, closes that login window and opens a new one, meant for the user to use. This can cause a lot of user confusion. They may think that:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The new window is representing error message, it should not have opened.</p>

<li>
<p>The application had an error and unexpectedly shutdown.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Utilize the EventBus to allow <code>UI</code>, <code>Model</code> and <code>Logic</code> to communicate</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Reduces coupling, as UI, Model and Logic doesn&#8217;t need to know about each other. If required, other classes can also listen for the Event and process accordingly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Needs some work to implement. Requires building up new classes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Let UI, Logic and Model know about each other, allowing them to call the relevant methods and do the relevant checks</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Grealy increases coupling. Not a good design decision, as it will make it harder to maintain the code in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 3:</strong> Build a command like system (similar to how Commands are implemented in the system) for UI to talk to Logic. Logic then uses the Command system to reply back to UI.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Reduces the amount of coupling added into the system. Provides a way for UI to get Logic to do things, in case more functionality is added that uses UI input.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the admin account would cause the system to be very insecure if it&#8217;s password couldn&#8217;t be changed, the admin account password must be changeable and stored somewhere, so that it persists across sessions. But where?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Place the storage in User Preferences</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement. A nice, centralized place to store general application information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: If the file is deleted, then the password will revert back to the default, which leaves the admin account vulnerable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we plan to store the system in a central server, the admin account&#8217;s information will be stored in the server, and not locally. As this is intended to change before the final release, we went for the option that is the simplest to implement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Add it into the address book.xml file</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: If the password was attempted to be removed through the deletion of the file, then this will also delete everyone in the system as well, thus rendering the access to the admin account useless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Since the file is stored in an xml format, it is easy for any dedicated attacker to find and remove the password information, reverting it to the default. Harder to implement, as would require large changes in the address book parser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 3:</strong> Store it within environment variables</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Somewhat harder to find. Ensures that admin password remains even when the data files are deleted.</p>

<h4 id="passwd-command"><a class="link" href="#passwd-command">passwd Command</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To change the password, a passwd command is required. However, this command is very different from the other commands. Specifically, it requires a chain of input, and subsequent inputs from the user should not be stored in history (otherwise the user&#8217;s password are easily retrievable).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is, however, not easy to handle. This command history is automatically populated by <code>LogicManager</code>, which <code>Command.execute</code> does not have access to. To complicate things further, <code>CommandParser</code> doesn&#8217;t handle exceptions like storing a command for future use, or redirecting user input to a specific Command.</p>
</div>

<p>To resolve this issue, <code>CommandResult</code> is extended to hold interceptors - a list of <code>ProcessCommand</code>. <code>ProcessCommand</code> is a functional interface, similar to Function except that it can throw a specific error as well. To implement passwd, it returns an implementor of <code>ProcessCommand</code> to <code>CommandResult</code>, which forwards it to <code>LogicManager</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>LogicManager</code> now accepts <code>ProcessCommand</code> from <code>CommandResult</code>, adding them to a list. As long as there exists at least one <code>ProcessCommand</code>, further messages are pushed to <code>ProcessCommand</code> instead of processed normally, and they aren&#8217;t added to history.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Build a foundation of <code>ProcessCommand</code> that will intercept user input and process it instead. If it does so, <code>LogicManager</code> doesn&#8217;t add the command to history.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Doesn&#8217;t increase coupling unnecessarily. Allows other functions to utilize this, allowing other commands to also easily extend to a chain of user inputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Harder to implement. Somewhat hard to understand, as it requires knowledge of lambdas and functional interfaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Apply a hack for passwd where <code>LogicManager</code> checks that if a passwd command is ongoing, it redirects there instead.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Greatly increases coupling. If further commands were to require the same functionality, this hack would need to be done again for that function.</p>

<h4 id="password-security"><a class="link" href="#password-security">Password Security</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a need to have passwords be stored securely as opposed to being stored in plain text. The standard today is to have password be salted and hashed, which is also the standard that OASIS is implemented in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this is handled within the <code>Password</code> class. API: <a href="https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Password.java"><code>Password.java</code></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Password</code> class stores the password in plaintext (if available), the salt and the hash of the password. The salt and the hash are always available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the password object was created this session (i.e. the user changed his password this session), the plaintext will be available. Otherwise, if it was read from the saved XML file, then only the salt and hash are available.</p>

</td>
<td class="content">
When checking if 2 Passwords are the same, it is better to call <code>isSamePassword</code> to verify if the 2 passwords are the same. <code>isSamePassword</code> checks if both passwords would have had the same plaintext. Utilizing <code>.equals</code> would also require the salt to match as well.

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Just store and save the password in plaintext.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Very easy to implement. Makes testing significantly easier. Can verify both appropriate input and output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: No security. Anyone who wants to view someone else&#8217;s password can just look into the data files and find it easily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Apply a hash to all passwords (i.e. SHA512).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Still somewhat easy to implement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Testing becomes slightly harder as test code can no longer rely on getting the password in plaintext. Still not very secure, rainbowtables and hash crackers exist that can easily get back the plaintext password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 3: (current choice):</strong> Apply a salt + hash to all passwords</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Full security suite. Ensures that we aren&#8217;t storing our user&#8217;s passwords, so if the database is compromised, our user&#8217;s passwords aren&#8217;t easily broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Very hard to implement. Testing becomes significantly harder because calling <code>.equals</code> on Passwords that are the same may return false due to differences in salt.</p>
