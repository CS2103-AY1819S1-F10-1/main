== Summary of contributions

The following section highlights my contributions to OASIS.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the function to add assignment/project*
** What it does: It allows the user with `Create_Assignment` permission to create new assignment into the system.
** Justification: OASIS is meant for small to medium companies. Within the companies there will be assignments that needs to be completed. Therefore to organize the assignments, it can be added into the system. This also allows the companies to have records of past and present assignments.
** Highlights: [technical skill gotten]This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a shortcut key feature to allow quick input of commands.
