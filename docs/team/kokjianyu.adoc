== PROJECT: OASIS

---

== Overview

Office Assistance Specialized Integration System (OASIS) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing employees, while allowing employees to handle some automatic features themselves.

== Summary of contributions

The following section shows my code contribution for OASIS.

=== Major Enhancement: Added ability to control the commands each employee can perform through usage of Permissions.

** What it does: Ensures that each command is executed only by an employee with the permission required for it.
** Justification: There are many commands in OASIS that should only be performable by employees with certain
authorization. Usage of permission allows the admins to easily ensure that previously stated criteria is met.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires modification to different components of the application, Model, Storage and Logic.
Therefore, implementation was challenging as it requires in-depth knowledge of the different components. 
However, usage of this
enhancement is made to be simple, simply needing only 1 line of code to be added into any new Command class to ensure that
it can only be executed by authorized employees.

=== Major Enhancement: Added ability to modify the permissions granted to an employee

** What it does: Modify the permissions of the employee.
** Justification: Allows for easy modification of permission
** Highlights: There are many different ways this functionality could have been done. Therefore, I spent quite some time to research how this functionality had been done on existing system, and have created and tested many different prototypes for this functionality before finally deciding on the current implementation. 

=== Major Enhancement: Added ability to view the permissions granted to an employee

** What it does: Display the list of permissions that an employee have.
** Justification: Users might not remember the permissions that have been assigned to an employee. This enhancement
give them a method to check it easily.

=== Minor Enhancement: Added Command Auto-Complete feature

** What it does: When user type in the command box, OASIS will predict what commands the user is going to run, and display a drop down list containing all suggestions.
**Justification: Users might not be able to memorize every commands. Having this enhancement will make it easier for them to find the commands they want to execute.
