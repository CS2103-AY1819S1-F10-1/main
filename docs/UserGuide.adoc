== Introduction

Office Assistance Specialized Integration System (OASIS) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing employees, while allowing employees to handle some automatic features themselves. More importantly, OASIS is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, OASIS can get your employee management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quickstart” to get started. Enjoy!
