== Introduction

Office Assistance Specialized Integration System (OASIS) is for users who prefer to use a desktop app for managing employees, while allowing employees to handle some automatic features themselves. More importantly, OASIS is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, OASIS can get your employee management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quickstart” to get started. Enjoy!

=== An Introduction to OASIS
The image shown below highlights the difference sections of OASIS's user interface:

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version 9 or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest oasis.jar https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The following Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds:
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  To login, enter in the username `Admin` and the password `Pa55w0rd`. Both values are case sensitive. These values are the default username and password combinations for the admin account, and are always available.
// end::quickstart-begin[]
.  After you have logged in, you should be taken to the following screen:
+
image::UiLoggedin.PNG[width="790"]
+
.  Now you can type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. +
e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all employees.
* **`add`**`-n John Doe -p 98765432 -e johnd@example.com -a 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 -s 10000` : adds an employee named John Doe with the email johnd@example.com, the address 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25, with a salary of 10,000.
* **`find`**`J*` : finds all employees where any of their names start with J.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Commands>> for details of each command.

[[Commands]]
== Commands

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add -n NAME`, `NAME`, `SECTOR` is a parameter which can be used as `add -n John -s Sales `.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `-n NAME [-t TAG]` can be used as `-n John Doe -t friend` or as `-n John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `-t TAG...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `-t friend`, `-t friend -t family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -p PHONE_NUMBER`, `-p PHONE_NUMBER -n NAME` is also acceptable.

// tag::autocomplete[]
*Command Auto Complete*

OASIS has provided you with a command auto complete feature to aid you with the usage of commands. With this functionality, you no longer have to memorise any commands!

When you type commands into the command box, a drop down list of possible commands will appear, as shown in the screenshot below.

image::autoCompleteDropDownList.png[width=300]

When the drop down list is shown, you can do the following:

* Use `↑` and `↓` to navigate through the list
* Press kbd:[Enter] to select the highlighted option

After selecting the command, you will see that the command will be displayed in the command box.

image::autoCompleteFinished.png[width=150]

If you wish to see a list of all commands, simply type kbd:[Space] into an empty command box. You should see the list as shown in the screenshot.
