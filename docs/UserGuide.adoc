== Introduction

Office Assistance Specialized Integration System (OASIS) is for users who prefer to use a desktop app for managing employees, while allowing employees to handle some automatic features themselves. More importantly, OASIS is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, OASIS can get your employee management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quickstart” to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version 9 or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest oasis.jar.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds.

.  After you have logged in, type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. +
e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all employees.
* **`add`**`-n John Doe -p 98765432 -e johnd@example.com -a 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 -s 10000` : adds an employee named John Doe with the email johnd@example.com, the address 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25, with a salary of 10,000.
* **`find`**`J*` : finds all employees that start with J.
